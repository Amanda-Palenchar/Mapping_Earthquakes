# Mapping_Earthquakes

By navigating to the Earthquake_Challenge folder, a user will be able to activate a live server from the index.html file to visualize a map showing all of the earthquakes in the world. The map offers street, satelite, and dark views, as well as filters that allow the user to navigate to all earthquakes, major earthquakes, and/or plate tectonics.
